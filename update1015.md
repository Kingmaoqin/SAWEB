# Update 2024-10-15

## UI Enhancements
- Added contextual ‚ùî help popovers to every data ingestion widget (tabular, image, sensor, and multimodal assets) so users know which files to prepare and which algorithms can consume them.
- Clarified throughout the wizards that only TEXGISA offers end-to-end multimodal optimisation, while other algorithms rely on pre-fused tables.
- Improved guidance for manifest ID fields and multimodal upload panels to reduce ambiguity and highlight required identifiers.

## Algorithm Routing
- Surfaced runtime feedback that automatically detects raw multimodal inputs, routes them to TEXGISA, and warns when other algorithms fall back to flat tables.
- Ensured the configuration handed to TEXGISA consistently includes multimodal sources while other algorithms ignore raw assets to avoid mismatched expectations.

## Documentation
- Documented these adjustments for internal tracking in this `update1015.md` file.
